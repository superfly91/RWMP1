#Real World Modeling Problem 1
##Introducing Box2D
To be presented on Tuesday 9^th October 2012

**Learning Outcomes**
+Incorporate Box2D API into a HTML5 page
+Create a world
+Create objects
+Associating graphical objects (sprites on canvas) to physics objects
+Visualise the objects and the world
+Detect collisions
+Respond to a collision
+Apply a force to an object

**Problem Description**
Produce a simple avoision game as follows:
+The player controls one object (controller applies a force to the object)
+The player's goal is to reach (collide with) a goal object to win
+The player avoids obstacles, updated automatically by Box2D, that move in different ways (each has different properties, e.g. shape, coefficients of restitution, friction etc.)
+If the player hits an object he is damaged in some way (e.g. his colour is green, which goes to orange on the first hit, then red on the second hit and dies if he is a third time)
+Static objects are used to form the world

Develop user stories from the above and break the stories into tasks. (Note: Each team member _must_ produce an obstacle object that is completely different to the obstacles that any other team member produces.)

Record what you learn in detail in your journal as you do the project.
